# platform specification

Status: planned contract, implementation and live acceptance not verified.

## Responsibility

Dependency composition, local runners, distribution and deploy overlays.

## Shared identifiers

Correlate task, intent revision, selected host, native session, browser instance, lease epoch, trace/span, artifact digest and Slack destination without placing credentials or raw private content in public receipts.

## Required behavior

Preserve explicit authority and unknown outcomes. Distinguish request admission, execution, validation, acceptance and delivery. Exact state transitions belong in component-specific specs added beside this file.

## Acceptance

1. Unit/contract tests with synthetic data.
2. Isolated integration tests against pinned upstream dependencies.
3. Bounded live acceptance in an authorized target.
4. Failure, restart, uncertain-effect reconciliation and rollback evidence.

None of these product gates has been run for this scaffold.
